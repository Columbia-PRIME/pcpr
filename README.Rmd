The R package `pcpr` implements Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), a robust
dimensionality reduction technique, for pattern recognition tailored to
environmental health data. The statistical methodology and computational details
are provided in Gibson et al. (2022).

## Installation

You can install the latest official CRAN release of `pcpr` with:

``` r
install.packages("pcpr")
```

The development version of `pcpr` can be installed from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Columbia-PRIME/pcpr")
```

`pcpr` can then be loaded and attached in your current R session as usual with

```{r lib}
library(pcpr)
```

## Getting help

Extensive documentation is available on our pkgdown [website](https://columbia-prime.github.io/pcpr/reference/index.html) and offline within R.
You can see the `pcpr` reference manual in R with:

``` r
help("pcpr")
```

A number of vignettes are available from within R. They can be browsed using:

``` r
browseVignettes("pcpr")
```

We recommend reading the vignettes in the following order:

1. [Theory crash course](https://columbia-prime.github.io/pcpr/articles/theory-crash-course.html), or if directly in R: `vignette("theory-crash-course")`
2. [Quickstart](https://columbia-prime.github.io/pcpr/articles/pcp-quickstart.html), or if directly in R: `vignette("pcp-quickstart")`
3. [Air pollution source apportionment with PCP](https://columbia-prime.github.io/pcpr/articles/pcp-applied.html), or if directly in R: `vignette("pcp-applied")`

## Modeling overview

PCP algorithms model an observed exposure matrix $D$ as the sum of three underlying
ground-truth matrices:

![](man/figures/README-pcp-model-1.jpeg)

a low-rank matrix $L_0$ encoding consistent patterns of exposure, a sparse
matrix $S_0$ isolating unique or outlying exposure events (that cannot be
explained by the consistent exposure patterns), and dense noise $Z_0$.

The models in `pcpr` seek to decompose an observed data matrix `D` into estimated
low-rank and sparse components `L` and `S` for use in downstream environmental health
analyses. The functions in `pcpr` are outfitted with three environmental health
(EH)-specific extensions making `pcpr` particularly powerful for EH research:

1. Missing value functionality
2. Leveraging potential limit of detection (LOD) information
3. Non-negativity constraint on the estimated `L` matrix

## PCP in environmental health studies

The methods in `pcpr` have already been applied in many environmental health studies. Several are listed below:

* Tao et al. (2023) apply PCP to investigate the association between source-specific fine particulate matter and myocardial infarction hospitalizations in NYC. 
* Wu et al. (2024) employ PCP for exposome profiling of environmental pollutants in seminal plasma, uncovering novel associations with semen parameters.
* Benavides et al. (2024) use PCP to develop a Community Severity Index in NYC, measuring the barrier effect of road infrastructure and traffic in cities.

## Usage
```{r usage}
# In the below example, we simulate a simple mixtures model and run PCP,
# comparing it's performance to that of PCA. For an in depth example with
# simulated data, see vignette("pcp-quickstart"). For more realistic
# PCP usage, check out vignette("pcp-applied").

# Simulate an environmental mixture
data <- sim_data(
  n = 100, p = 10, r = 3,
  sparse_nonzero_idxs = seq(1, 1000, 101),
  sigma = 0.05
)
D <- data$D # Observed matrix
L_0 <- data$L # Ground truth low-rank matrix
S_0 <- data$S # Ground truth sparse matrix
Z_0 <- data$Z # Ground truth noise matrix

# Simulate a limit of detection for each chemical in mixture
lod_info <- sim_lod(D, q = 0.1)
D_lod <- lod_info$D_tilde
lod <- lod_info$lod

# Simulate missing observations
corrupted_data <- sim_na(D_lod, perc = 0.05)
D_tilde <- corrupted_data$D_tilde

# Finish simulating LOD by imputing values < LOD with LOD/sqrt(2)
lod_root2 <- matrix(
  lod / sqrt(2),
  nrow = nrow(D_tilde),
  ncol = ncol(D_tilde), byrow = TRUE
)
lod_idxs <- which(lod_info$tilde_mask == 1)
D_tilde[lod_idxs] <- lod_root2[lod_idxs]

# Run grid search to obtain optimal r, eta parameters
# (Not shown here to save space, see vignette("pcp-quickstart")
# for full example which obtains r = 3, eta = 0.224)
r_star <- 3
eta_star <- 0.224

# Run non-convex PCP to estimate L, S from D_tilde
pcp_model <- rrmc(D_tilde, r = r_star, eta = eta_star, LOD = lod)

# Clean up sparse matrix
pcp_model$S <- hard_threshold(pcp_model$S, thresh = 0.4)

# Benchmark with PCA's attempt at recovering L
D_imputed <- impute_matrix(D_tilde, apply(D_tilde, 2, mean, na.rm = TRUE))
L_pca <- proj_rank_r(D_imputed, r = r_star)

# Evaluate PCP ground truth
data.frame(
  "Obs_rel_err" = norm(L_0 - D_imputed, "F") / norm(L_0, "F"),
  "PCA_L_rel_err" = norm(L_0 - L_pca, "F") / norm(L_0, "F"),
  "PCP_L_rel_err" = norm(L_0 - pcp_model$L, "F") / norm(L_0, "F"),
  "PCP_S_rel_err" = norm(S_0 - pcp_model$S, "F") / norm(S_0, "F"),
  "PCP_L_rank" = matrix_rank(pcp_model$L),
  "PCP_S_sparsity" = sparsity(pcp_model$S)
)
```
