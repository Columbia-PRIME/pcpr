#' Square root principal component pursuit (convex PCP)
#'
#' @description
#' `root_pcp()` implements the convex PCP algorithm "Square root principal
#' component pursuit" as described in
#' [Zhang et al. (2021)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/f65854da4622c1f1ad4ffeb361d7703c-Abstract.html)
#' , outfitted with environmental health (EH)-specific extensions as described
#' in Gibson et al. (2022).
#'
#' Given an observed data matrix `D`, and regularization parameters `lambda` and
#' `mu`, `root_pcp()` aims to find the best low-rank and sparse estimates `L`
#' and `S`. The `L` matrix encodes latent patterns that govern the observed
#' data. The `S` matrix captures any extreme events in the data unexplained by
#' the underlying patterns in `L`.
#'
#' Being convex, `root_pcp()` determines the rank `r`, or number of latent
#' patterns in the data, autonomously during it's optimization. As such, the
#' user does not need to specify the desired rank `r` of the output `L` matrix
#' as in the non-convex PCP model [rrmc()].
#'
#' Experimentally, the `root_pcp()` approach to PCP modeling has best been able
#' to handle those datasets that are governed by well-defined underlying
#' patterns, characterized by quickly decaying singular values. This is typical
#' of imaging and video data, but uncommon for EH data. For observed data with a
#' complex low rank structure (slowly decaying singular values), like EH data,
#' [rrmc()] may offer a better model estimate.
#'
#' Three EH-specific extensions are currently supported by `root_pcp()`:
#' 1. The model can handle missing values in the input data matrix `D`;
#' 2. The model can also handle measurements that fall below the limit of
#'    detection (LOD), if provided `LOD` information by the user; and
#' 3. The model is also equipped with an optional non-negativity constraint
#'    on the low-rank `L` matrix, ensuring that all output values in `L` are
#'    \eqn{> 0}.
#'
#' @section The objective function:
#' `root_pcp()` optimizes the following objective function:
#' \deqn{\min_{L, S} ||L||_* + \lambda ||S||_1 + \mu ||L + S - D||_F}
#' The first term is the nuclear norm of the `L` matrix, incentivizing `L` to be
#' low-rank. The second term is the \eqn{\ell_1} norm of the `S` matrix,
#' encouraging `S` to be sparse. The third term is the Frobenius norm
#' applied to the model's noise, ensuring that the estimated low-rank and sparse
#' models `L` and `S` together have high fidelity to the observed data `D`.
#' The objective is not smooth nor differentiable, however it is convex and
#' separable. As such, it is optimized using the Alternating Direction
#' Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm Boyd et al. (2011), Gao et al. (2020).
#'
#' @section The `lambda` and `mu` parameters:
#' * `lambda` controls the sparsity of `root_pcp()`'s output `S` matrix;
#'   larger values of `lambda` penalize non-zero entries in `S` more
#'   stringently, driving the recovery of sparser `S` matrices. Therefore,
#'   if you a priori expect few outlying events in your model, you might
#'   expect a grid search to recover relatively larger `lambda` values, and
#'   vice-versa.
#' * `mu` adjusts `root_pcp()`'s sensitivity to noise; larger values of `mu`
#'   penalize errors between the predicted model and the observed data (i.e.
#'   noise), more severely. Environmental data subject to higher noise levels
#'   therefore require a `root_pcp()` model equipped with smaller `mu` values
#'   (since higher noise means a greater discrepancy between the observed
#'   mixture and the true underlying low-rank and sparse model). In virtually
#'   noise-free settings (e.g. simulations), larger values of `mu` would be
#'   appropriate.
#'
#' The default values of `lambda` and `mu` offer _theoretical_ guarantees
#' of optimal estimation performance, and stable recovery of `L` and `S`. By
#' "stable", we mean `root_pcp()`'s reconstruction error is, in the worst case,
#' proportional to the magnitude of the noise corrupting the observed data
#' (\eqn{||Z||_F}), often outperforming this upper bound.
#' Cand√®s et al. (2011) obtained the guarantee for `lambda`, while
#' [Zhang et al. (2021)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/f65854da4622c1f1ad4ffeb361d7703c-Abstract.html)
#' obtained the result for `mu`.
#'
#' @section Environmental health specific extensions:
#' We refer interested readers to
#' Gibson et al. (2022) for the complete details regarding the EH-specific
#' extensions.
#'
#' **Missing value functionality:** PCP assumes that the same data generating
#' mechanisms govern both the missing and the observed entries in `D`. Because
#' PCP primarily seeks accurate estimation of _patterns_ rather than
#' individual _observations_, this assumption is reasonable, but in some edge
#' cases may not always be justified. Missing values in `D` are therefore
#' reconstructed in the recovered low-rank `L` matrix according to the
#' underlying patterns in `L`. There are three corollaries to keep in mind
#' regarding the quality of recovered missing observations:
#' 1. Recovery of missing entries in `D` relies on accurate estimation of
#'    `L`;
#' 2. The fewer observations there are in `D`, the harder it is to accurately
#'    reconstruct `L` (therefore estimation of _both_ unobserved _and_ observed
#'    measurements in `L` degrades); and
#' 3. Greater proportions of missingness in `D` artifically drive up the
#'    sparsity of the estimated `S` matrix. This is because it is not possible
#'    to recover a sparse event in `S` when the corresponding entry in `D` is
#'    unobserved. By definition, sparse events in `S` cannot be explained by
#'    the consistent patterns in `L`. Practically, if 20% of the entries in `D`
#'    are missing, then at least 20% of the entries in `S` will be 0.
#'
#' **Handling measurements below the limit of detection:** When equipped with
#' LOD information, PCP treats any estimations of values known to be below the
#' LOD as equally valid if their approximations fall between 0 and the LOD. Over
#' the course of optimization, observations below the LOD are pushed into this
#' known range \eqn{[0, LOD]} using penalties from above and below: should a
#' \eqn{< LOD} estimate be \eqn{< 0}, it is stringently penalized, since
#' measured observations cannot be negative. On the other hand, if a \eqn{< LOD}
#' estimate is \eqn{>} the LOD, it is also heavily penalized: less so than when
#' \eqn{< 0}, but more so than observations known to be above the LOD, because
#' we have prior information that these observations must be below LOD.
#' Observations known to be above the LOD are penalized as usual, using the
#' Frobenius norm in the above objective function.
#'
#' Gibson et al. (2022) demonstrates that
#' in experimental settings with up to 50% of the data corrupted below the LOD,
#' PCP with the LOD extension boasts superior accuracy of recovered `L` models
#' compared to PCA coupled with \eqn{LOD / \sqrt{2}} imputation. PCP even
#' outperforms PCA in low-noise scenarios with as much as 75% of the data
#' corrupted below the LOD. The few situations in which PCA bettered PCP were
#' those pathological cases in which `D` was characterized by extreme noise and
#' huge proportions (i.e., 75%) of observations falling below the LOD.
#'
#' **The non-negativity constraint on `L`:** To enhance interpretability of
#' PCP-rendered solutions, there is an optional non-negativity constraint
#' that can be imposed on the `L` matrix to ensure all estimated values
#' within it are \eqn{\geq 0}. This prevents researchers from having to deal
#' with negative observation values and questions surrounding their meaning
#' and utility. Non-negative `L` models also allow for seamless use of methods
#' such as non-negative matrix factorization to extract non-negative patterns.
#' The non-negativity constraint is incorporated in the ADMM splitting technique
#' via the introduction of an additional optimization variable and corresponding
#' constraint.
#' @inheritParams rrmc
#' @param lambda,mu (Optional) A pair of doubles each in the range `[0, Inf)`
#'   regularizing `S` and `L`. `lambda` controls the sparsity of the output
#'   `S` matrix; larger values penalize non-zero entries in `S` more
#'   stringently, driving the recovery of sparser `S` matrices. `mu` adjusts the
#'    model's sensitivity to noise; larger values will penalize errors between
#'   the predicted model and the observed data more severely. It is highly
#'   recommended the user tunes both of these parameters using
#'   [grid_search_cv()] for each unique data matrix `D`. By default, both
#'   `lambda` and `mu` are `NULL`, in which case the theoretically optimal
#'   values are used, calculated according to [get_pcp_defaults()].
#' @param non_negative (Optional) A logical indicating whether or not the
#'   non-negativity constraint should be used to constrain the output `L`
#'   matrix to have all entries \eqn{\geq 0}. By default, `non_negative = TRUE`.
#' @param max_iter (Optional) An integer specifying the maximum number of
#'   iterations to allow PCP before giving up on meeting PCP's convergence
#'   criteria. By default, `max_iter = 10000`, suitable for most problems.
#' @param verbose (Optional) A logical indicating whether or not to print
#'   information in real time over the course of PCP's optimization. By
#'   default, `verbose = FALSE`.
#'
#' @returns A list containing:
#'   * `L`: The rank-`r` low-rank matrix encoding the `r`-many latent patterns
#'     governing the observed input data matrix `D`. `dim(L)` will be the same
#'     as `dim(D)`. To explicitly obtain the underlying patterns, `L` can be
#'     used as the input to any matrix factorization technique of choice, e.g.
#'     PCA, factor analysis, or non-negative matrix factorization.
#'   * `S`: The sparse matrix containing the rare outlying or extreme
#'     observations in `D` that are not explained by the underlying patterns in
#'     the corresponding `L` matrix. `dim(S)` will be the same as `dim(D)`.
#'     Most entries in `S` are `0`, while non-zero entries identify the extreme
#'     outlying observations in `D`.
#'   * `num_iter`: The number of iterations taken to reach convergence. If
#'     `num_iter == max_iter` then `root_pcp()` did not converge.
#'   * `objective`: A vector containing the values of `root_pcp()`'s objective
#'     function over the course of optimization.
#'   * `converged`: A boolean indicating whether the convergence criteria were
#'     met before `max_iter` was reached.
