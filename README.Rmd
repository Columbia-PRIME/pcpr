The R package `pcpr` implements Principal Component Pursuit (PCP), a robust
dimensionality reduction technique, for pattern recognition tailored to
environmental health data. The statistical methodology and computational details
are provided in [Gibson et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10479).

## Installation

You can install the development version of pcpr from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("Columbia-PRIME/pcpr")
```

## Modeling overview

PCP algorithms model an observed exposure matrix $D$ as the sum of three underlying
ground-truth matrices:

![An example PCP model](man/figures/README-pcp-model-1.jpeg)
<!-- $$\underset{\text{mixture}}{D_{n \times p}} = \underset{\text{low-rank}}{L_0} + \underset{\text{sparse}}{S_0} + \underset{\text{noise}}{Z_0}$$ -->

a low-rank matrix $L_0$ encoding consistent patterns of exposure, a sparse
matrix $S_0$ isolating unique or outlying exposure events (that cannot be
explained by the consistent exposure patterns), and dense noise $Z_0$. All of
these matrices are of dimension $n \times p$, where $n$ is the number of
observations (e.g. study participants or measurement dates) and $p$ is the
number of exposures (e.g. chemical and/or non-chemical stressors). Beyond this
mixtures model, the main assumption made by PCP is that
$Z_0 \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)$ consists of i.i.d. Gaussian noise
corrupting each entry of the overall exposure matrix $D$.

The models in `pcpr` seek to decompose an observed data matrix `D` into estimated
low-rank and sparse components `L` and `S` for use in downstream environmental health
analyses. The functions in `pcpr` are outfitted with three environmental health
(EH)-specific extensions making `pcpr` particularly powerful for EH research:

1. Missing value functionality
2. Leveraging potential limit of detection (LOD) information
3. Non-negativity constraint on the estimated `L` matrix

## Usage

`pcpr` supplies all of the functions needed to incorporate PCP into an
environmental health analyses.

Below we run through a brief example, using `pcpr` to simulate an environmental mixture
and then recover the mixture's underlying consistent patterns and sparse outliers.

### Simulating data

The `sim_data()` function lets users generate simple mixtures models for
quick experimentation. Let's use it to simulate a noisy environmental mixture
comprised of 100 observations of 10 chemicals, with three underlying chemical
exposure patterns (or a rank $r = 3$), extreme outlying exposure events along the diagonal of the
matrix, and dense Gaussian noise corrupting all the measurements in the matrix:

```{r sim data}
library(pcpr)

data <- sim_data(
  n = 100, p = 10, r = 3,
  sparse_nonzero_idxs = seq(1, 1000, 101),
  sigma = 0.05
)
D <- data$D
L_0 <- data$L
S_0 <- data$S
Z_0 <- data$Z
```

We can see `L_0` has 3 underlying patterns using the `matrix_rank()` function:

```{r matrix rank}
matrix_rank(L_0)
```

Because our mixtures data is often incomplete in practice, let's simulate a random 5% of the values as missing `NA` with the `corrupt_mat_randomly()` function:

```{r corrupt mat randomly}
corrupted_data <- corrupt_mat_randomly(D, perc = 0.05)
D_tilde <- corrupted_data$D_tilde
D_tilde_0fill <- D_tilde
D_tilde_0fill[is.na(D_tilde)] <- 0
```

The `D_tilde` matrix represents our observed, messy mixtures model, suffering from incomplete `NA` observations.
In a moment we will run our PCP model on `D_tilde` directly. The `D_tilde_0fill` matrix imputes `NA` values
with `0`, allowing us to call functions that do not support missing `NA` values.

### PCP model selection

There are two PCP algorithms shipped with `pcpr`: the convex `root_pcp()`
[[Zhang et al. (2021)](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/f65854da4622c1f1ad4ffeb361d7703c-Abstract.html)]
and non-convex `rrmc()` [[Cherapanamjeri et al. (2017)](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/cherapanamjeri17a.html)].
To figure out which model would be best for our data, let's inspect the singular values of our
observed mixture using the `sing()` method:

```{r sing}
plot(sing(D_tilde_0fill), type = "b", main = "Singular values of the observed mixture")
```

`rrmc()` is best suited for data characterized by slowly decaying singular values, indicative of complex underlying patterns.
Most EH data can be described this way. `root_pcp()` is best for data characterized by rapidly decaying singular values, indicative of very well-defined latent patterns.

For a simple example like the above, both PCP models are perfectly suitable. 
We will use `rrmc()`, as this is the model environmental health researchers will likely employ most frequently.

### Tuning PCP parameters via grid search

To estimate the low-rank and sparse matrices, `rrmc()` needs to be given a maximum rank `r` and regularization parameter `eta`. To determine the optimal values of `r` and `eta`, we will conduct a brief
grid search using the `grid_search_cv()` function. In our grid search below, we will examine all models from ranks 1 through 5 and all values of `eta` near the default, calculated with `get_pcp_defaults()`.

The `rrmc()` approach to PCP uses an iterative rank-based procedure to recover `L` and `S`, meaning it first constructs a rank `1` model and iteratively builds up to the specified rank `r` solution.
As such, for our grid search with `grid_search_cv()`, we pass `etas` as the `grid` argument we are searching and we send `r` = 5 as a constant parameter common to all models in the search.
Since `length(etas) = 6` and `r` = 5, we are grid searching through 30 different PCP models. The `num_runs` argument in `grid_search_cv()` determines how many (random) tests should be performed for each unique model setting.
By default, `num_runs = 100`, so our grid search tunes `r` and `eta` by measuring the performance of 300 different PCP models.

```{r grid search}
eta_0 <- get_pcp_defaults(D_tilde)$eta
cat(paste("Default eta value: ", eta_0))
etas <- data.frame("eta" = sort(c(0.1 * eta_0, eta_0 * seq(1, 10, 2))))
gs <- grid_search_cv(D_tilde, pcp_fn = rrmc, grid = etas, r = 5)
r_star <- gs$summary_stats$r[1]
eta_star <- round(gs$summary_stats$eta[1], 3)
head(gs$summary_stats)
```

Inspecting the `summary_stats` table from the output grid search provides the mean aggregated statistics for each of the 30 distinct parameter settings we tested.
The grid search correctly identified the rank `r r_star` solution as the best (lowest relative error rate). The corresponding `eta` = `r eta_star`.

### Running PCP

Now we can run our PCP model:

```{r rrmc}
pcp_model <- rrmc(D_tilde, r = r_star, eta = eta_star)
```

Let's briefly inspect PCP's estimate of the sparse matrix `S`, and fix any values that are "practically" zero using the `hard_threshold()` function.
The histogram below shows a majority of the entries in `S` are between -0.2 and 0.2, so we will call those values "practically" zero, and the rest
true outlying exposure events.

```{r sparse}
hist(pcp_model$S)
pcp_model$S <- hard_threshold(pcp_model$S, thresh = 0.2)
```

### Benchmarking with PCA

Before evaluating our PCP model, let's see how well a more traditional method such as
Principal Compoenents Analysis (PCA) can recover `L_0`, to provide a benchmark for comparison.

The `proj_rank_r()` function (project matrix to rank `r`) approximates an input matrix
as low-rank using a rank-`r` truncated SVD, the same way PCA approximates a low-rank matrix.
Normally, a researcher would need to determine `r` subjectively. We will give PCA an advantage
by sharing PCP's discovery from the above grid search that the solution should be of rank `r r_star`:

```{r pca}
L_pca <- proj_rank_r(D_tilde_0fill, r = r_star)
```

### Evaluating PCP against the ground truth

Finally, let's see how we did in recovering `L_0` and `S_0`. We will examine the relative error between our model's estimates and the simulated ground truth matrices.
We use the Frobenius norm to calculate the relative errors between the matrices:

```{r performance metrics}
data.frame(
  "Obs_rel_err" = norm(L_0 - D_tilde_0fill, "F") / norm(L_0, "F"),
  "PCA_L_rel_err" = norm(L_0 - L_pca, "F") / norm(L_0, "F"),
  "PCP_L_rel_err" = norm(L_0 - pcp_model$L, "F") / norm(L_0, "F"),
  "PCP_S_rel_err" = norm(S_0 - pcp_model$S, "F") / norm(S_0, "F"),
  "PCP_L_rank" = matrix_rank(pcp_model$L)
)
```

PCP outperformed PCA by quite a bit! PCP's relative recovery error on the `L_0` matrix stood at only `r round(norm(L_0 - pcp_model$L, "F") / norm(L_0, "F") * 100, 2)`%,
compared to an observed relative error of `r round(norm(L_0 - D_tilde_0fill, "F") / norm(L_0, "F") * 100, 2)`% and PCA's relative error of `r round(norm(L_0 - L_pca, "F") / norm(L_0, "F") * 100, 2)`%.
PCP's sparse matrix estimate was only off from the ground truth `S_0` by `r round(norm(S_0 - pcp_model$S, "F") / norm(S_0, "F") * 100, 2)`%.

We can now pair our estimated `L` matrix with any matrix factorization method of our choice (e.g. factor analysis or NMF) to extract the latent chemical exposure patterns.
These patterns, along with the isolated outlying exposure events in `S`, can then be incorporated with any outcomes of interest in downstream epidemiological analyses.

## A real world application

The `pcpr` package also ships with a real world air pollution dataset `queens` consisting of fine particulate matter measurements (in Âµg/m^3) of
26 PM2.5 chemical species, recorded every three to six days from 04/04/2001 through 12/30/2021 courtesy of an EPA AQS monitoring site in Queens, New York City (NYC):

```{r queens}
queens
```

You can follow along a real source apportionment analysis using the `queens` data in the source apportionment vignette.

## PCP in environmental health studies

The methods in `pcpr` have already been applied in many environmental health studies. Several are listed below:

* [Tao et al. (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1097/EE9.0000000000000243) apply PCP to investigate the association between source-specific fine particulate matter and myocardial infarction hospitalizations in NYC. 
* [Wu et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c10314) employ PCP for exposome profiling of environmental pollutants in seminal plasma, uncovering novel associations with semen parameters.
* [Benavides et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2024.108526) use PCP to develop a Community Severity Index in NYC, measuring the barrier effect of road infrastructure and traffic in cities.
